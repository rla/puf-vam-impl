#summary Overview of the code layout.

= Packages =

  * {{{tr.fn.ast}}} - classes of abstract syntax tree. These also contain helper methods such as finding free variables and abstract interpretation.
  * {{{tr.fn.gen}}} - code generation (codeB, codeV and codeC).
  * {{{tr.fn.grammar}}} - Puf parser. The grammar specification for ANTLR is in the file Puf.g.
  * {{{tr.fn.opt}}} - contains classes that implement optimizations that are run before code generations.
  * {{{tr.fn.post}}} - classes for processing after code generation.
  * {{{tr.fn.pre}}} - classes for processing before code generation. #include statement is implemented here.
  * {{{tr.fn.test}}} - the main test package. Uses non-visual mama to run the tests.
